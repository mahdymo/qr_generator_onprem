# Locally owned QR Generator 

## Overview 

In this repo. we aim to create a self-obtained QR Code generator that replaces Google quickchart. while quickchart if an amazing way to kickstart testing and some projects, it worth noting that some organizations don't prefer to send over the secret keys and users' IDs over to 3rd parties without proper liability contract in place. 

* One question always rises why a lot of people use quickchart service if it's not that secure? 
Many rely on the fact that anonymity gives that sense of security, as quickchart doesn't keep track of to which secret key this organization belong to, then no one can track it back to us. I believe you can get how this is not totally true. 

## Prerequisites 

In order to have this app deployed, you need the below, 
- python3
- pip
